      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Aiden, a student with a big passion for trains, technology, and art. Trains have always fascinated me, from the mechanics of their engines to the complex history and evolution of rail transport around the world. Whether it's the early steam locomotives that pioneered long-distance travel or the high-speed trains that define modern rail, each train tells a story of engineering progress and human ingenuity.</p>
      
      <p>One of my favorite things about trains is how each type is designed for a specific purpose: cargo, speed, or passenger comfort. I've spent hours learning about the intricacies of train designs, including the differences in track gauge, locomotive power, and the aerodynamic shapes of high-speed trains. Each detail can impact performance, making trains an engineering marvel that I never tire of exploring.</p>

      <h3>Programming and Web Development</h3>
      <p>Aside from trains, I’m also diving into the world of programming and web development. Building this website has been an exciting challenge, and it’s a way for me to showcase my train knowledge and share it with others. Learning HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript has opened up new possibilities for creating and customizing content online. Each line of code is like laying down tracks, guiding visitors through a well-structured journey.</p>

      <h3>Art and Character Design</h3>
      <p>When I'm not reading up on trains or coding, I enjoy drawing and designing characters, often inspired by the dynamic world of trains. Art helps me add a creative edge to my technical interests, and I like bringing imagination to the technical precision that both programming and train design require.</p>

      <p>Thank you for stopping by. I hope you enjoy exploring my site as much as I’ve enjoyed creating it!</p>
